# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-with-Explainable-AI-Tools
Implementation of various Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the proneness of a individual to Heart Disease.
We have performed various steps to make the dataset capable to being trained and tested by the selected Machine Learning model's namely: Feature Extraction, Null Value Removal, Outlier Detection and Removal, One-Hot-Encoding.
After our data set is pre-processessed we have devided our dataset into Training and Testing Dataset.
Then we have performed K-Cross Validation followed by Model Selection. In our project we we have selected Logistic Regression to be the best suited model for our dataset.
Then we have trained the model followed by model testing. Logistic Regression model gave us a score of 92.59% approximately.
Finally we have used Explainbale AI tools like LIME(for local interpretation) and SHAP(for global interpretation) to understand the model's respective decision.
